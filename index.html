      <p>
       I found a <span class="lv"><i>love</i></span> for me<br/>
       Oh, <span class="drlng">darlin'</span>, just dive right in and follow my lead<br/>
       Well, I found a girl <span class="beauti">beautiful</span> and <span class="beauti">sweet</span><br/>
       <span class="bLine"> Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me<br/></span>
        </p>
      <p>
       'Cause we were just kids when we <span class="lv"><i>fell in love</i></span><br/>
        Not knowin' what it was<br/>
        I will not give you up this time<br/>
        But, <span class="drlng">darlin'</span>, just <span class="beauti">kiss</span>me slow<br/>
        Your <span class="lv"><i>heart</i></span> is all I own<br/>
        <span class="bLine"> And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine<br/></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br/>
        Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br/>
        When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br/>
        But you heard it, <span class="drlng">darlin'</span>, you look <span class="beauti">perfect tonight</span><br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="prsn"><i>Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know</i><br/></span>
        She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home<br/>
        <span class="bLine">I found a love to carry more than just my secrets</br></span>
        To carry love, to carry children of our own<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bLine"> We are still kids, but we're so in love<br/></span>
        Fightin' against all odds<br/>
        I know we'll be alright this time<br/>
        <span class="drlng">Darlin'</span>, just hold my hand<br/>
        <span class="prsn"><i></i>Be my girl, I'll be your man</i><br/></span>
        I see my future in your eyes<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bLine">  Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br/></span>
        Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br/>
        <span class="prsn"><i> When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful</i><br/></span>
        I don't deserve this, <span class="drlng">darlin'</span>, you look <span class="beauti">perfect tonight</span><br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        <div class="tune">No, no, no<br/>
        Mm, no, no<br/></div>
      </p>
      <p>
        <div class="bLine"> Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br/></div>
        We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song<br/>
        I have <span class="beauti">faith</span> in what I see, now I know I have met<br/>
        <span class="prsn"><i> An angel in person and she looks perfect</i><br/></span>
        I don't deserve this, you look<span class="beauti"> perfect tonight</span><br/>
